--- 4TI LENS/FRAME TRACER DATA LOGGER ---

This is a server that listens for and records data from
the National Optronics 4Ti lens/frame tracer. 

Right now it only understands the G-C format provided
by the tracer device. G-C format does not include 3D trace
data. OMA+Z does. OMA+Z format support ought to be
added at some point to fix this and to facilitate more sophisticated
automation of communication between a host (computer) and device 
(tracer).

The 0MA+Z protocol is defined in the Data Communication Standard
document. The document included in this repo is version 3.10 of
the Standard. The version that the 4Tx adheres to may be an earlier
version. Keep this in mind if/when implementing OMA+Z support. 

Data is recorded in JSON format.

Please refer to the 4Tx manual for more info including how
to configure the $Tx to communicate using different protocols
and data formats.
